# Semaphore_vs_Synchronized
Exercise in mutual exclusion using semaphores and synchronization

Prompt:

        A group of N faculty members are sitting around a bowl of candy, which holds M pieces of candy.  
        Each of the N faculty members spends his life thinking and eating candy. They must have a piece of candy to think.
        One Teaching Assistant spends his life sleeping except that when the bowl is empty he is woken up
        and fills the candy bowl. 
        Only one faculty member can access the bowl at a time.
        
        
        1) Write a solution to the above program using a semaphore implementation for synchronization and mutual exclusion.
           Each faculty member should be a thread.  The Teaching Assistant should be a thread.

        2) Write a solution using a ‘monitor’ type approach such as a Java synchronized class for the bowl.
        
        
        
###Don't Cheat###

This is an assignment I completed while attending SHSU. If you're viewing this code with the intent to cheat, you'll likely be caught.
